DESCRIPTION
    Poet is a modern Perl web framework designed especially for Mason
    developers. It uses PSGI/Plack for server integration, Mason for request
    routing and templating, and a selection of best-of-breed CPAN modules
    for caching, logging and configuration.

FEATURES
    *   A common-sense directory hierarchy for web development

    *   A configuration system that scales elegantly with multiple coders
        and multiple layers (development/production)

    *   Integration with Log4perl for logging, wrapped with dead-simple
        configuration

    *   Integration with CHI for powerful and flexible caching

    *   The power of Mason, an object-oriented templating system, for
        request routing and content generation

    *   Easy access to common objects and utilities from anywhere in your
        application

    *   Conventions and defaults based on the author's best practices from
        over fifteen years of Perl web development; and

    *   The freedom to override just about any of Poet's behaviors

DOCUMENTATION
    All documentation is indexed at Poet::Manual.
